I'm currently pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer Science to transfer to a four-year university. Courses I have taken include Programming Concepts and Methodology in C++ I and II, as well as assembly language. I am nearing the completion of my discrete structures course.
As part of my degree path, I'm also taking a lot of math, and I'm currently enrolled in Calculus I.
I took Java-based computer science I and II several years ago, and about a year of information systems (Web development and structured programming).
I also took a digital circuits course several years ago.
I'm currently working on a Zombie Arena game based on the tutorial in the book Beginning C++ Game Programming by John Horton. This summer, I completed a game, which I called Rapunzel, based on the first tutorial in this book for a game called Timber!
For Computer Architecture and Organization: Assembly, I completed an LC-3 assembly language program to average five exam scores and display the minimum, maximum, average score, and their corresponding letter grade.
For Discrete Structures, I programmed a text-based Blackjack game that applies the concepts learned in that course and implements algorithms demonstrating the logic according to its rules, continually updating the player on the probability of obtaining 21 or going bust.
Fun Fact: I compiled a Linux from Scratch version 6.4 (except for a GUI) and Gentoo Linux. I have also compiled a custom Linux kernel a couple of times. I compiled my own Berkeley BOINC on Linux to enable GPU computing to contribute to scientific distributed computing projects such as PrimeGrid. I ran my own, personal Linux Samba file server at home for 11 years. I also compiled the open-source game LordsAWar on Linux.
